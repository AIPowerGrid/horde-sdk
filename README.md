# AI-Horde-Shared-Models

With the power of pydantic, you can simplify intferfacing with the [AI-Horde's suite of APIs](https://github.com/db0/AI-Horde).

For now, this library is focusing on providing a robust interface to the [Image Ratings](https://dbzer0.com/blog/the-image-ratings-are-flooding-in/) that are powering [DiffusionDB](https://poloclub.github.io/diffusiondb/). See `example.py` for an idea of how to start.
